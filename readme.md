This application is project number 3 (of 5) of Udacity's Full Stack Developer 
Nanodegree program. It builds upon the two previous courses: Full Stack 
Foundations & Authentication/Authorization. The application makes use of
starter code provided by Udacity.

The purpose of this excersice is to develop a RESTful web application using 
the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth 
authentication. As a result, students will learn when to properly use the 
various HTTP methods available to a developer and how these methods relate to 
CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations. The application should 
provide a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a 
user registration and authentication system. Registered users should have the
ability to create categories and items for those categories. As well as 
provide means for updating and deleting those categories and items. 
Modification and deletion of categories and items is restricted in the 
following manner:

1. Only registered users may modify categories or items
2. A user may only modify or delete categories or items which she has created.

Additionally, the application must meet the following minimum requirements:

Criteria 	  		|	Description
--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------
API Endpoints | Application implements JSON endpoints with all required content.
CRUD: Read 	  | Application reads category and item information from a database.
CRUD: Create  |	Application includes a form allowing users to add new items and correctly processes submitted forms.
CRUD: Update  |	Application includes a function to edit/update a current record in the database table and correctly processes submitted 
				forms.
CRUD: Delete  |	Application includes a function to delete a current record.
Authentication and Authorization | 	Application implements a third-party authentication and authorization service; and create, delete and update operations do consider authorization status prior to execution. Make sure there is a ‘Login’ and ‘Logout’ button/link in the project. The aesthetics of this button/link is open for you to design.

Code Quality  |	Code is ready for personal review and neatly formatted.

Comments 	  |	Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures.

Documentation |	A README file (this document you are reading) is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.
